# WTWR Backend - project 12

Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, ESLint

### This project is the server-side component of the WTWR (“What to Wear?”) application.

### It’s built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and provides a RESTful API for managing users and clothing items.

The server handles core functionality such as:

## Creating, retrieving, and deleting clothing items

## Managing user data

## Allowing users to like or unlike items

## Validating data and handling errors gracefully

### All data is stored in a MongoDB database, and the application follows best practices for error handling, data validation, and consistent API responses.
